**Insurance Premium Prediction**
Health insurance premiums are critical for individuals and insurance providers alike. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts health insurance premiums based on various individual characteristics. Leveraging advanced algorithms, we intend to provide a valuable tool for both insurance seekers and providers to estimate insurance costs effectively. 

**Kindey Stone Prediction**
The primary goal is to enhance the efficiency. and accuracy of medical diagnosis by predicting the likelihood of kidney stone presence. The focus is on the application of linear regression models and a neural network to enhance the accuracy and speed of kidney stone diagnosis.
